# Graph RAG

## Introduction

 Graph  RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technology that uses graph databases to store relationships between data points, replacing traditional text embedding methods like Chuck and enhancing the performance of RAG. This project is base on [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master) and [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j?tab=readme-ov-file).
